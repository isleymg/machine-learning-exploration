Best Practices
--------------
Workflow
- Data preparation
    - Understand the business problem
    - Collect all relevant fields
    - Maintain consistency of field values
    - Deal with missing data
- Training sets generation: Data preprocessing + Feature engineering
    - Determine categorical features with numerical values
    - Decide on whether or not to encode categorical features
    - Decide on whether or not to reduce dimensionality and if so how
    - Decide on whether or not to scale features
    - Perform feature engineering with domain expertise
    - Document how each feature is generated
- Algorithm training, evaluation, selection
    - Choose the right algorithm(s) to start with. Consider:
            * Size of the training dataset
            * Dimensionality of the dataset
            * Whether the data is linearly separable
            * Whether features are independent
            * Tolerance and tradeoff of bias and variance
            * Whether online learning is required
        - Naive Bayes
        - Logistic regression
        - SVM
        - Random forest
        - Neural networks
    - Reduce overfitting
    - Diagnose overfitting and underfitting
- Deployment and monitoring
    - Save, load, and reuse models
    - Monitor model performance
    - Update models regularly
